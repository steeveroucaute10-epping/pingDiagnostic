# Chart Interpretation Guide

This guide explains how to read and interpret the visualization charts generated by the Ping Diagnostic Tool. These charts help you understand network stability, identify patterns, and communicate issues effectively to support teams.

## Overview

Each visualization contains **4 panels** that work together to give you a complete picture of your network's health:

1. **Timeout Events Over Time** (Top Left)
2. **Ping Duration Over Time** (Top Right)
3. **Stable Time Between Timeout Clusters** (Bottom Left)
4. **Timeout Duration Distribution** (Bottom Right)

Plus a **summary box** at the bottom with key metrics.

## Panel 1: Timeout Events Over Time

### What It Shows
A timeline view of when network timeouts occurred during your monitoring session.

### How to Read It
- **X-axis**: Time (hours:minutes:seconds)
- **Y-axis**: Timeout status (1 = timeout occurred, 0 = ping succeeded)
- **Red line**: Step chart showing each ping result
- **Red shaded areas**: Highlighted timeout clusters (groups of consecutive timeouts)

### What to Look For

**✅ Good Network:**
- Mostly flat line at 0 (very few or no timeouts)
- No red shaded areas, or very small, isolated ones
- Long periods of stability (line stays at 0)

**⚠️ Problematic Network:**
- Frequent spikes to 1 (many individual timeouts)
- Large red shaded areas (long timeout clusters)
- Pattern of repeated disruptions

### Example Interpretations

**"Occasional brief dropouts"**
- Small, isolated red spikes
- Most of the line is at 0
- Red shaded areas are small and infrequent

**"Frequent disruptions"**
- Many red spikes throughout the timeline
- Multiple red shaded areas
- Line rarely stays at 0 for long periods

**"Prolonged outages"**
- Large red shaded areas (wide blocks)
- These indicate the network was down for extended periods

## Panel 2: Ping Duration Over Time

### What It Shows
The response time (latency) of successful pings over time, with a rolling average trend line.

### How to Read It
- **X-axis**: Time (hours:minutes:seconds)
- **Y-axis**: Ping duration in milliseconds (ms)
- **Blue dots**: Individual ping response times
- **Green line**: Rolling average (smoothed trend)

### What to Look For

**✅ Good Network:**
- Consistent, low latency (typically <50ms for local gateway, <100ms for internet)
- Green line is relatively flat and low
- Blue dots cluster tightly around the green line
- No sudden spikes or dramatic increases

**⚠️ Problematic Network:**
- High latency (consistently >100ms for gateway, >200ms for internet)
- Green line trending upward over time
- Large variations in blue dots (inconsistent performance)
- Sudden spikes to very high values (>500ms)

### Example Interpretations

**"Stable, low latency"**
- Blue dots mostly between 1-20ms (gateway) or 10-50ms (internet)
- Green line is flat and low
- Tight clustering of dots

**"Degrading performance"**
- Green line gradually increases over time
- Blue dots show more variation
- May indicate network congestion or hardware issues

**"Intermittent latency spikes"**
- Occasional blue dots spike to high values (100ms+)
- Green line may show temporary increases
- Could indicate interference or congestion during specific times

**"High baseline latency"**
- Green line consistently high (>100ms)
- Blue dots cluster around high values
- May indicate distance to router, interference, or network congestion

## Panel 3: Stable Time Between Timeout Clusters

### What It Shows
How long the network remained stable (uptime) between each disruption event. Each bar represents the time between one timeout cluster ending and the next one beginning.

### How to Read It
- **X-axis**: Disruption index (1st disruption, 2nd disruption, etc.)
- **Y-axis**: Stable time in minutes
- **Blue bars**: Duration of each stable period
- **Red dashed line**: Median stable time (typical uptime between disruptions)

### What to Look For

**✅ Good Network:**
- Tall bars (long stable periods, minutes to hours)
- Red line is high (median stable time is long)
- Few bars (few disruptions overall)
- Consistent bar heights (predictable stability)

**⚠️ Problematic Network:**
- Short bars (stable periods are brief, seconds to minutes)
- Red line is low (median stable time is short)
- Many bars (frequent disruptions)
- Highly variable bar heights (unpredictable)

### Example Interpretations

**"Highly stable network"**
- Bars are tall (10+ minutes, often hours)
- Red line is high
- Only a few bars (infrequent disruptions)

**"Frequent but brief disruptions"**
- Many bars (frequent disruptions)
- Bars are short (<5 minutes)
- Red line is low
- Indicates network is unstable but recovers quickly

**"Occasional major outages"**
- Few bars (infrequent disruptions)
- Some bars are very tall (long stable periods)
- Some bars may be short (brief disruptions)
- Indicates intermittent but significant issues

**"Unpredictable stability"**
- Bar heights vary dramatically
- Some very tall, some very short
- Hard to predict when next disruption will occur

## Panel 4: Timeout Duration Distribution

### What It Shows
A histogram showing how many timeout clusters fall into different duration categories. This helps you understand whether disruptions are brief or prolonged.

### How to Read It
- **X-axis**: Timeout duration ranges (≤1s, 1-2s, 2-5s, 5-10s, 10-30s, >30s)
- **Y-axis**: Number of occurrences (how many timeout clusters in each category)
- **Red bars**: Count of timeout clusters in each duration range

### What to Look For

**✅ Good Network:**
- Most bars are in the left side (shorter durations: ≤1s, 1-2s)
- Few or no bars in longer duration ranges
- Low total count (few disruptions overall)

**⚠️ Problematic Network:**
- Bars in longer duration ranges (5-10s, 10-30s, >30s)
- High counts in any category
- Distribution skewed toward longer durations

### Example Interpretations

**"Brief, minor disruptions"**
- Most bars in ≤1s and 1-2s ranges
- Few or no bars in longer ranges
- Indicates quick recovery

**"Prolonged outages"**
- Significant bars in 10-30s or >30s ranges
- Indicates network stays down for extended periods
- More noticeable impact on user experience

**"Mixed disruption patterns"**
- Bars spread across multiple ranges
- Some brief, some prolonged
- Indicates inconsistent network behavior

**"Frequent brief dropouts"**
- Many bars, but mostly in ≤1s and 1-2s ranges
- High count but short duration
- May cause issues with real-time applications

## Insights Section (in Log Files)

The log files include an "Insights & Guidance" section that automatically interprets your data. Here's what the insights mean:

### "Frequent disruptions (>=4 per hour) detected"
- **Meaning**: Network is highly unstable, experiencing disruptions very frequently
- **Action**: This is a serious issue requiring immediate attention

### "Multiple disruptions per hour indicate intermittent instability"
- **Meaning**: Network has issues but not as severe as frequent disruptions
- **Action**: Monitor patterns and consider contacting support

### "Low disruption frequency observed"
- **Meaning**: Issues occur but are infrequent
- **Action**: May be acceptable depending on use case, but worth monitoring

### "Stable periods between disruptions are very short (<2 minutes)"
- **Meaning**: Network recovers quickly but doesn't stay stable long
- **Action**: Indicates underlying instability that needs investigation

### "Stable periods average under 10 minutes between disruptions"
- **Meaning**: Network has some stability but disruptions are regular
- **Action**: Moderate concern, worth documenting and reporting

### "Median outage duration exceeds 10 seconds"
- **Meaning**: When disruptions occur, they last a while
- **Action**: These are noticeable to users and may impact real-time applications

### "Median outage duration is several seconds"
- **Meaning**: Disruptions are brief but noticeable
- **Action**: May cause issues with video calls, gaming, or streaming

### "Outages are brief, typically clearing within a couple seconds"
- **Meaning**: Quick recovery from disruptions
- **Action**: Less concerning, but still worth monitoring

## Tips for Sharing with Support

1. **Include both targets**: Share visualizations for both your gateway (192.168.x.x) and Google DNS (8.8.8.8)
   - Gateway issues = local network problem
   - DNS issues but gateway OK = internet/ISP problem
   - Both have issues = broader network problem

2. **Note the time range**: Check when disruptions occur
   - Same time daily? (may indicate interference or congestion)
   - Random? (may indicate hardware issues)
   - During specific activities? (may indicate bandwidth issues)

3. **Compare panels**: Look for correlations
   - Do latency spikes coincide with timeouts? (congestion)
   - Are stable periods getting shorter over time? (degrading hardware)
   - Are timeout durations increasing? (worsening condition)

4. **Provide context**: Include information about:
   - What you were doing when issues occurred
   - How long you've been experiencing problems
   - Whether issues affect all devices or just one

5. **Use the summary metrics**: The summary box gives support teams quick reference points
   - "Disruptions per hour: 6.2" immediately tells them frequency
   - "Median stable time: 45s" tells them how brief uptime is

## Common Patterns and What They Mean

### Pattern: "Clustered timeouts at specific times"
- **Possible causes**: Interference from other devices, scheduled network maintenance, congestion during peak hours
- **Look for**: Timeout clusters in Panel 1 at similar times

### Pattern: "Gradually increasing latency"
- **Possible causes**: Network congestion, degrading hardware, interference buildup
- **Look for**: Green line in Panel 2 trending upward over time

### Pattern: "Stable periods getting shorter"
- **Possible causes**: Hardware failure, increasing interference, network overload
- **Look for**: Bars in Panel 3 getting progressively shorter

### Pattern: "Timeout durations getting longer"
- **Possible causes**: Hardware degradation, worsening interference, network congestion
- **Look for**: Panel 4 showing more timeouts in longer duration ranges over time

### Pattern: "Random brief spikes"
- **Possible causes**: Interference, brief congestion, wireless signal issues
- **Look for**: Isolated red spikes in Panel 1, brief timeouts in Panel 4
